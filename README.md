# Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics #
## Visual Odometry Pipeline ##

The goal of this mini-project is to implement a simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline 
with the most essential features: initialization of 3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two 
frames, pose estimation using established 2D â†” 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new 
landmarks.

### Prerequisites ###
MATLAB 2017b with

- Image Toolbox

- Optimization Toolbox

- Statistics Toolbox

### How To Run The Pipeline ###

1.) Clone the repository

2.) in src/parameters.m, select the dataset by setting the variable ds

3.) run main.m to start the pipeline
