# Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics #
## Visual Odometry Pipeline ##

The goal of this mini-project is to implement a simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline 
with the most essential features: initialization of 3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two 
frames, pose estimation using established 2D â†” 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new 
landmarks.
