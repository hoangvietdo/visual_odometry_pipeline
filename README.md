# Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics #
## Visual Odometry Pipeline ##

The goal of this mini-project is to implement a simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline 
with the most essential features: initialization of 3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two 
frames, pose estimation using established 2D â†” 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new 
landmarks.

### Prerequisites ###
MATLAB 2017b with

- Image Toolbox

- Optimization Toolbox

- Statistics Toolbox

### How To Run The Pipeline ###

1.) Clone the repository.

2.) Download the standard datasets ([KITTI, Malaga, Parking](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html)) and copy them into the
    visual_odometry_project/datasets directory. The directories must be renamed to 
    'kitti', 'malaga', and 'parking'. 

3.) In src/parameters.m, select the dataset by setting the variable **ds** at the beginning of the file. 
    Optionally, also change the pipeline parameters there.

4.) Go into visual_odometry_project/src, and run main.m to start the pipeline.

### Screencasts ###

Please find [here the screencasts](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AHjNfthDAVzBY2az-X1W9HUt4fE05oeL
) of this pipeline applied to six different datasets.
Note that the built up map during the run is shown at the very end of the clips in more detail.
