## Visual Odometry Pipeline ##

A simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline with the most essential features: 
* initialization of 3D landmarks (8-Point algorithm, RANSAC)
* keypoint tracking between two frames (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi feature tracker)
* pose estimation using established 2D â†” 3D correspondences (p3p algorithm, RANSAC, nonlinear pose optimization)
* triangulation of new landmarks.

### Prerequisites ###
MATLAB 2017b with

- Image Toolbox
- Optimization Toolbox
- Statistics Toolbox

### How To Run The Pipeline ###

1.) Clone the repository.

2.) Download the standard datasets ([KITTI, Malaga, Parking](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html)) and copy them into the
    visual_odometry_project/datasets directory. The directories must be renamed to 
    'kitti', 'malaga', and 'parking'. 

3.) In src/parameters.m, select the dataset by setting the variable **ds** at the beginning of the file. 
    Optionally, also change the pipeline parameters there.

4.) Go into visual_odometry_project/src, and run main.m to start the pipeline.

### Screencasts ###

Please find [here the screencasts](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AHjNfthDAVzBY2az-X1W9HUt4fE05oeL
) of this pipeline applied to six different datasets.
Note that the built up map during the run is shown at the very end of the clips in more detail.
The pipeline runs at ~1.28Hz on a i-7 2.3GHz processor.
